Our research showed us that professionals in our target market were more inclined to try a new product as a result of a peer advice.

Based on this information, I decided to build a referral campaign.<!--more-->

## Step 1: Analysis

First, **collect the data**.

Our database confirms with numbers what the qualitative analysis had suggested. Our clients can be grouped in clusters geographically colocated and segmented by age.

It is likely that our new clients were mostly made aware of our product by other clients. We certainly need to continue our work of creating new clusters, but we can do something to foster the mechanism that is "organically" is sustaining our growth: the word of mouth.

## Step 2: Sketch the project

It's time to find a way to encourage our clients to spread the voice.

My idea is simple: a referral program. **Bring a friend, get a reward**.

I don't know what kind of reward would work, and what is sustainable by the business. It's time to involve more people.

## Step 3: Get the team onboard

Every successful initiative is backed by a motivated team... and the way I like to build motivation is participation.

I will need the help of many different professionals from within the Company:

* the sales department knows what clients want;
* the support department knows what clients need;
* the IT folk will tell me what is technically feasable;
* a business developer can calculate what is sustainable.

I need the help of one professional from each of these functions. It does not need to be a new assignment: a few hours per week will be enough. The duration of the project is fixed: we will launch before Christmas.

## Step 4: Sketch the idea

The team is enthusiast and brings many good ideas.

A common language is essential for easing communication and save time and frustration: it is time for establishing what developers call an "[Ubiquitous language][ubiquitous-language]". Here's our working dictionary:

* the project is called **WOM**, as in "Word Of Mouth"
* the client who refers a friend will be called "**doctor**"
* the potential client who was referred will be called "**friend**"

We settle for offering substantial discounts on additional modules for both the Doctor and the Friend.

And now the creative part! I pull out my prototyping tool (I use Sketch) and **start drawing**.

## Step 5: Build and start testing

With the help of the developer in the team, we build the first functioning iteration: the prototype. This is not the time for caring about the details: we want to test early and test often.

Once we have a prototype, it's time to start test it. Our Company can count on:

* a dedicated Domain Expert: a person who knows the market we operate in, for having been a professional in the field for 20 years
* a beta-users pool: a handful of clients who expressed interest in making our product better.

They are involved at different stages of each iteration.

While the product heads towards acceptation, it is time for iteratively polishing the details:

* find and fix edge cases as we discover them
* add production-ready text and images

## Step 6: The launch day

Our deadline is approaching. As we approach finalisation, we discover each day a something we could do better, or a new detail requiring attention. When passion is there, everyone wants perfection. This is the moment requiring the greatest deal of focus: we are not aiming for perfection, but for measurable improvements. In a world of [bounded rationality][bounded-rationality], we aim for "great", never for "perfect"!

We have designed, created, tested, iterated. It's time to ship.

## Step 7: Measure the results

Two months in, the campaign attracted 25 referrals, 12 of which have asked for a sales follow-up.

We learned that blahbla is blabla.
