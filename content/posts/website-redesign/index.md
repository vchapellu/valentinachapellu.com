In July 2019, Alfadocs’ product offering was rearranged into independently purchasable modules. The company public communication needed to be adapted. The CEO tasked me to lead the renovation of our website.

## My Role

As the UX designer on the project, I am responsible for the user research and product design. My role in this project is to find the best way to enact business requirements based on what I learn about the target users. I then communicate with the rest of the team using wireframes, mockups and prototypes.

## Discovery

I started the project with some research.

Alongside with a **competitor investigation**, I needed to answer to some questions:
* What differentiates us from our competitors?
* Who are our current users?
* What are the website users looking for?
* What is the message we want to communicate?
* What action do we want to trigger?

Having previously worked with the marketing and sales departments on the definition of multiple **user types** helped me a lot with the definition of user needs.

I had many conversations with the Founders Board to understand the direction they wanted imprint to the product and communication.

With all this accumulated knowledge I came back to my team to start working together.

## Definition and Ideation

During the discovery phase I found some issues I wanted to work with with the rest of the team:
1. In the website there were two CTAs:
  Demo Request - Main CTA
  Video Demo - Secondary CTA
  Demo request: LP with data request to receive a call from a sales and, after that, activate a trial period.
  Video Demo: LP with data request to see a 6 minutes video. Only 1/6 of the page viewers submitted the data, and could accede to the video.
  BOTH Demo Request and Video Demo generate a task for sales to call the lead and activate a trial period.
2. The product was scarcely pictured in the website.
3. In the web version there were 3 different menus: global navigation bar, hamburger and third menu in the footer
4. It is not clear at first sight that the product is a management software for dental practices
5. I analyzed the users behaviour on the website using Google Analytics and I discovered that a huge amount of people landed on the website after searching “Alfadocs accedi” (“Alfadocs login”) on Google.
6. The CTA "Prova Subito" (Try Now) is tricky for the users. They can't actually try immediately! They should give their contact data and wait for a call from a salesperson who activates the actual account.

Together with the team we analysed the issues I raised and started to precisely **define what we wanted to communicate**, what was the **desired action** and give a more precise definition of the various modules we wanted to present in the 60 seconds main video and in the secondary part of the homepage. During the session **I hand-sketched all the relevant changes** we wanted to apport to the homepage.

We decided to eliminate the video demo CTA and replace it with a brand new 60 seconds video of the product right next to the value proposition and main CTA.
Scrolling down the homepage we wanted to show a brief description of the modules next to an eye-catching SVG presenting the module and a secondary CTA pointing to the relevant product page.
I took on the task of writing and discussing with the CEO some proposals for a **new value proposition** and to prepare the copy and CTAs for the description of the modules.
We agreed on keeping only the global navigation bar for the web version and hamburger menu for the mobile version. We also shorten the menu: 5 items instead of 8 and to highlight the login button on top-right for customers.

## Prototype

Together with the CMO we made a list of the features we wanted to show in the video, put them in a logical order and give all the video materials to the graphic designer so that he could start working on the creatives.

I designed a first version of the homepage with **Sketch** and shared it with the rest of the team using **Zeplin**. After some iterations I designed a pixel perfect version we agreed on.

I worked with the graphic designer to optimise the concept video and the music. The final product was longer than expected but everybody in the Company was positively impressed by the quality and the consistency of the message.

With the front-end developer we tested the feasibility of the whole project and we deployed a first version to test.

## Testing & Reiteration

During the first 30 days we made many a/b tests:
* A/B test on the value proposition
* A/B test a secondary CTA
* A/B test adding quotes from our satisfied customers

To help everybody in the Company keeping consistency with the new product direction along all communication materials, I prepared a light and easy-to-understand **styleguide**.
