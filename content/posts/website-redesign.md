In July 2019, Alfadocs’ product offering was rearranged into independently purchasable modules. The company public communication needed to be adapted. The CEO tasked me to lead the renovation of our website.

## My Role

As the UX designer, I am responsible for user research and product design. My role in this project is to find the best way to enact business requirements based on what I learn about the target users. I then communicate with the rest of the team using wireframes, mockups and prototypes.

## Discovery

I start the project with some research.

Alongside with a **competitor investigation**, I need to find answers to some questions:
* What differentiates us from our competitors?
* Who are our current users?
* What are the website users looking for?
* What is the message we want to communicate?
* What action do we want to trigger?

Having previously worked with the marketing and sales departments on the definition of multiple **user types** helps me a lot with the definition of the user needs.

After many conversations with the Founders Board to understand the direction they want to imprint to the product and communication, I come back to my team and start working together.

## Definition and Ideation

During the discovery phase I find some issues I want to work out with the rest of the team:
1. It is not clear at first sight that the product is a management software for dental practices
1. In the website there are two CTAs:
    * Demo Request - Main CTA. LP with data request to receive a call from a sales and, after that, activate a trial period.
    * Video Demo - Secondary CTA. LP with data request to see a 6 minutes video. Only 1/6 of the page viewers submitted the data, and could accede to the video.
    * BOTH Demo Request and Video Demo generate a task for the sales people to call the lead and activate a trial period.
1. The CTA "Prova Subito" (Try Now) is tricky for the users. They can't actually try immediately! They should give their contact data and wait for a call from a salesperson who activates the actual account.
1. The product is scarcely pictured in the website.
1. There are three different menus: global navigation bar, hamburger and a third menu in the footer. Confusing!
1. A users behaviour analysis carried through Google Analytics showed that many customers landed on the website after searching “Alfadocs accedi” (“Alfadocs login”) on Google.

Together with the team we analyse the issues and start to precisely **define what we want to communicate**, what is the **desired action** and give a more precise definition of the various modules we want to present. During the session **I hand-sketch all the changes** we decide to apport to the homepage.

We choose to eliminate the video-demo CTA and replace it with a brand new short video of the product, to be placed right next to the value proposition and main CTA.
Scrolling down the homepage we want to show a brief description of the modules next to an eye-catching SVG presenting the module and a secondary CTA pointing to the relevant product page.
I take on the task of writing and discussing some proposals with the CEO for a **new value proposition**. I also prepare the copy and CTAs for the description of the modules.
We agree on only keeping the global navigation bar for the web version and the hamburger menu for the mobile version. We also shorten the menu: 5 items instead of 8.

We also add a big login button top right-hand for our customers.

## Prototype

Together with the CMO we make a list of the features we want to show in the video, we put them in a logical order and we give all the video materials to the graphic designer.

I design a first version of the homepage with **Sketch** and shar it with the rest of the team using **Zeplin**. After some iterations I design a pixel-perfect version we can agree on.

I work with the graphic designer to optimise the concept video and the music. The final product is longer than expected but the team likes it! We keep it because it is very consistent with our message.

With the front-end developer we test the feasibility of the whole project and we deploy a first version to test.

## Testing & Reiteration

During the first 30 days we make many a/b tests:
* A/B test on the value proposition
* A/B test a secondary CTA
* A/B test adding quotes from our satisfied customers

To help everybody in the Company keeping consistency with the new product direction, I prepare a light and easy-to-understand **styleguide**.
