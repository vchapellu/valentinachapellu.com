Empathise is the first phase of the [Design Thinking](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking "Design Thinking - Interaction Design Foundation") framework, as defined by the Stanford d.School. [Empathy](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/empathy "Empathy - Cambridge Dictionary") is a key ability for a designer: **through empathy you can understand, and by understanding users behaviours you can find solutions tailored to users needs**.

When the CEO called me to work in AlfaDocs, he asked me to lead the transition of his Marketing team into a Growth team. I was the only remote worker in the Company. I was hired as a UX Designer, but in charge of a Marketing team. Not an easy task! But the Design Thinking methodology has been made to tackle wicked problems, and so I did.

## Planning

First things first, **I needed to get a better understanding of Company’s customer journey and processes.**
My research object would have been my colleagues.
For the investigation I decided to use the toolbox of the UX Researcher: **the technique I chose was the semi-structured interview.** I planned to make a video interview with every single person working in marketing, sales, support and customer success.

I prepared a friendly message with clear purposes and easy instructions for each of my colleagues. When it comes to users I have a more formal attitude, but in this case I wanted to make it clear, from the first moment, that I was part of the group and they could trust me.

##### Slack message:

> Hi [NAME], nice to meet you! As you know I am new, and I have to learn a ton about customers, internal processes, communication strategy... To speed up the onboarding process I decided to ask my questions to the real experts here: my colleagues :)
>
> Do you have 40minutes this week for a video call with me? No preparation needed.

To prepare my questions I needed a smattering of the product, the structure and the perceived problems. I started my exploration with an open conversation with the CEO and the Head of Sales: they were my stakeholders and I also wanted to understand what their expectations were. Based on those conversations I prepared the script for the interviews.

## The Interviews

For the majority of the colleagues I spoke with, that was the first personal contact they had with me. I tried to be as transparent as possible about my role and the purpose of my research. I made it clear that there were no right or wrong answers and that our conversation would have remained confidential. I was interested in their experience. I was there to listen and understand.

##### Script of the interview (5min)

>INTRO: Hi [NAME], thank you for your time! As I told you in my message there is so much I need to understand! When it comes to understanding users’ environment and behaviour I use interviews. As I am very familiar with this tool I prepared some questions for you. :)
I want to make it clear that there are no right or wrong answers and that the outcome of our conversation will be anonymous. My purpose is to understand processes, problems and our Company strengths from YOUR point of view. I will take some notes during our conversation, so that I won’t forget anything.
If it is ok for you I would start by telling you who I am and why I am here, then I’d like to know something about you, your job and your expectations.
>[Brief introduction] So :) as you may know I am a UX designer…
>What about you?

##### Questions (30 minutes)
Based on the main topics I wanted to deepen, I prepared a list of broad questions for everybody and some other questions for specific departments for a total of 11–13 questions for every participant.

It happened that during some of the interviews I discovered unexpected topics to which I decided to dedicate more questions.

Here the list of overall questions:

>* How would you describe our customers? How old are they? Are they from rural or urban areas? - everybody
>* How do we reach the doctors? - everybody (to deepen with marketing)
>* How do you measure the impact of your activities? - marketing
>* What makes a lead qualified? - marketing, sales
>* How do you usually approach a lead for the first time? - sales
>* Who are the direct competitors of our Company? - everybody
>* What makes us different from our competitors? - everybody
>* What do you think is the biggest strength of our Company? - everybody
>* How many steps a lead should take before becoming a customer? - marketing, sales
>* What are the customers’/doctors’ most frequently asked questions? - everybody
>* Are most doctors looking for a complete solution or a specific feature? - sales
>* What is the topic the doctors are more interested in? - everybody
>* Is there a specific feature that the doctors ask for, but we can’t offer? - sales, cs, support
>* Do you remember the last time you spoke with a doctor that met us through a colleague? How frequent is the word of mouth? Do you think that a doctor referred from a colleague is more willing to buy? Did you ever speak with a doctor that wanted to refer a colleague? If so, why does he speak with you and not directly to the colleague? - sales, cs, support
>* How do you reach the customers? Chat, email, phone? - support, cs
>* Has ever happened to you to sell a feature to a customer you were helping/onboarding? If so, how frequently? - cs, support
>* How long does it take to onboard a customer? - cs
>* What’s the most frequent problem you have to deal with? Did you ever speak with your team lead/manager about it? - everybody
>* Grab a wand and make a wish to improve your work, what would it be? - everybody

## The Results

Thanks to the interviews with my colleagues I identified problems and difficulties as well as many unexpressed potentialities and strong points of the product.

I remember everyone being positively surprised to be interviewed. Many of my colleagues confessed it was the first time someone asked for their opinion and collected details about their tools and techniques. Participation was high and almost all of my colleagues welcomed my initiative and kept addressing to me their ideas and concerns for several weeks on. They got in touch with me multiple times, during the following weeks, to add details or proposals. I suddenly became the go-to person not only for the marketing topics, but also for every kind of idea or possible innovation.

## Conclusions

Running those interviews has probably been one of my best intuitions in that kind of contest. In a very short time I had the possibility to have a glimpse on my coworkers’ thoughts, processes and approaches that it would otherwise required months to understand. On the other hand, I created an empathic bond with everybody by treating them as experts, genuinely asking them to help me understand their job and their problems.

**A network of collaborating peers is a powerful multiplier of your positive impact in a Company. Build it early!**
