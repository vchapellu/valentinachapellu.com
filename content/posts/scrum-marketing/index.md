title: "5 techniques borrowed from IT that can boost your Marketing team"

As a **UX Designer in charge of a Marketing team**, I faced a big change in my Company: the transition from a chaotic early-stage startup to a more sustainable business.

The organisation needs to grow in complexity and get more flexible.<!--more-->

## 1. Mind the User Flows

When building a product, it is essential to analyse and visualise how the product is used, where the users click, and why.

This same process can be applied to Marketing items.

In the most obvious case, we trace the path of a target from a marketing email to a landing page, to some conversion. What happens next?

Using the tools of the UX, We can build a consistent prospective-client experience, along the lines of the Marketing Funnel.

## 2. A standard review process

When I joined the team, if marketing items were deemed important enough, they were reviewed by the CEO. Otherwise, they were published right away.

That process worked for an early-stage startup, but obviously could not scale.

The IT has a very structured approach to reviews: their tooling enforces the four-eye principle.

I added a simple rule to our own process: **every piece of content that is published must be reviewed by a colleague**. We designated one specialist per target medium who must be involved as either the author or the reviewer. It does not need to be the CEO!

As for the tooling: you don't need to disrupt your workflows by introducing yet another tool. Google Docs, or whatever editor that supports some form of commenting, can do the trick.

## 3. The sprint goal

AGILE is not widely recognised outside the IT world; however, I believe it can be effective for boosting productivity.

It can happen that we lose ourselves in the daily routine and forget _why_ we are doing what we are doing.

Scrum teams work in chunks of either 1, 2 or 3 weeks, they call them Sprints. Each sprint has a goal: the team effort is focused on getting that specific thing done.

Not every team can work in sprints, but I like the concept of having a shared goal. If you think that your team is losing purposeor focus, try setting a deadline and a goal. You may have fires to estinguish and quartely goals to achieve; however, a shorter-term intermediate objective can often help.

## 4. The retrospective

It is healthy for the team to regularly sit and think about what went good, what went wrong, and what could be done better. Most of the colleagues I have worked with, ultimately only want to do their job the best they can. Let them talk, discuss problems, propose new ideas.

There are tons of literature on how to run a retrospective; pick what you need, elaborate, and discuss with the team. They will know what's better for the team!

## 5. Monitoring

IT folks love to hang big TVs on their walls, with colorful graphs depicting the real-time status of their servers.

**What if we could see what happens to our campaigns, and react accordingly?**

Sometimes, A:B testing and iteration are too slow. Moreover, they don't catch everything: we definitely want to know if:
* a campaign suddenly stops getting any click
* a social media interaction is generating much more traffic than expected
* there's a spike in mailing-list unsubscribes

Defining metrics and monitoring them lets us promptly identify:
* technical glitches
* social media over-reactions
* misplaced content

**It's time for us to get big TVs!**
