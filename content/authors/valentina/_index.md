I am a **UX Designer** based in Berlin, Europe.

{{< figure src="/images/vale.jpeg" >}}

Thanks to my **Social Sciences background**, I know how **user research and data analysis** work... and most importantly, I know how they do _not_ work.

When I moved to Germany, back in 2016, I started working in the startups environment, this granted me great exposure to Product teams and to the web technologies. **I was working in the marketing departments** but I felt like it wasn't the right place for me. I started to explore the world of UX and it was love at first sight. I learned to hand-sketch my ideas, I practiced with Sketch and I learn basics of HTML and CSS. **For the first time my diverse background was a positive factor** and I was free to create, experiment, be a customer advocate and in the meanwhile listen to business needs trying to find a balance. 

Becoming a UX Designer is an unending journey. I read a lot, everyday I try new tools and approaches, I attend conferences. I feel part of this outstanding community of tireless innovators.
